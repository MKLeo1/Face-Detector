<h1>C++ Face Detector</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

The C++ Face Detector project is a small code implementation that utilizes the Haar Cascade algorithm and the OpenCV library to detect faces using the user's camera. The project aims to provide real-time face detection functionality by leveraging the power of computer vision techniques.

The project enables users to access their camera feed and visualize the real-time detection of faces. When a face is detected, the code can outline the face with bounding boxes to highlight the detected region. This provides a simple yet effective solution for further computer vision projects.
